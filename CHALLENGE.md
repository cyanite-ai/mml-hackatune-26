# Sounds Like You
### Taste-driven, explainable music recommendation (Munich Music Labs × Cyanite)

> How can people discover music through how it actually sounds, by taste, by mood, by
> "something like this but…", in ways they can understand?

Build a music discovery / recommendation experience on the Cyanite API, grounded in
audio (how a track sounds), not in collaborative filtering (what other people listened to).

---

## The challenge

Most discovery still runs on keyword search, rigid metadata filters, or collaborative
filtering. All of them miss the most direct signal: what the music actually sounds like.
Build discovery that listens.

You have a catalog of ~362,000 tracks already analyzed and indexed by Cyanite's audio AI.
Recommendations should be content/audio-based, driven by mood, instrumentation, energy,
character, and similarity in sound, and reachable through natural language, seed tracks,
and a listener's taste (taste = the sound of what they like). And they should
be explainable.

---

## How the Cyanite API works (the core loop)

1. Search returns a ranked list of track IDs + similarity scores (no metadata), via:
- Free-text / prompt search: natural language → matching track IDs.
- Similar-by-ID: a track already in the index → acoustically similar track IDs.
- Both can be combined with filtering on Cyanite tags.

> Search is by track ID or text prompt only. No raw embeddings/vectors. Build
> taste/personalization on IDs, prompts, and tags.

2. Tagging. Search returns IDs, not metadata. To display or reason about a result,
fetch its tags from the Tagging API by track ID:

```
query (text prompt OR seed track ID)  ->  ranked track IDs (+ scores)
   -> fetch tags per ID (Tagging API)  ->  rank / explain / display
```

Because everything is grounded in audio analysis, every recommendation can be explained in
human terms ("shares the same calm, acoustic mood and a similar slow tempo").

## Cyanite tagging: model outputs

Independent per-track outputs (audio analysis). Most taxonomy outputs include per-tag
scores (0 to 1) and time-segmented values, which is what lets you explain what drives a
result and where.

| Output | What it tells you |
|---|---|
| Main genre | High-level genre from a fixed taxonomy (23 genres), with scores |
| Subgenre | Finer genre within the detected main genre (can be null) |
| Free genre | Open-vocabulary genre tags (niche genres, no fixed list) |
| Mood (simple) | Compact mood vocabulary (13 moods), with scores |
| Mood (advanced) | Fine-grained mood (~130 moods), with scores |
| Instruments | Which instruments are present (47), presence level, and where over time |
| Character | Sonic "personality" (e.g. bold, warm, mysterious, playful, epic) |
| Movement | Rhythmic feel / groove (driving, flowing, pulsing, …) beyond raw BPM |
| BPM | Numeric tempo in beats per minute, with confidence |
| Tempo | Coarse perceived tempo label (slow → fast) |
| Key | Musical key, with confidence |
| Time signature | Meter (e.g. 4/4, 3/4), with confidence |
| Valence / Arousal | Continuous emotion axes, plus energy level, energy change, emotion profile, emotion change |
| Musical era | Estimated production era / year the track sounds like |
| Music-for | Use-case / sync suitability tags (hundreds: film, workout, meditation, gaming, …) |
| Vocals | Vocal presence and gender |
| Vocal style | Detailed characterization of any vocals |
| Voiceover | Spoken-word / talkover detection and dominance |
| Auto-description | A short natural-language description of the track |
| Representative segment | Start/end of the most representative part of the track (great for previews) |
| Augmented keywords | A weighted dictionary of free keyword associations |

(Tagging is provided by Cyanite, so lean on the Cyanite API.)

## Cross-cutting requirement: Explainability

Let a user ask "why this track?" and get a convincing answer grounded in the audio
analysis: Cyanite's tags/scores, the auto-description, or the prompt/filters you inferred, how the results relate to the given search reference.

---

## What we provide (data pack)

So you can focus on Cyanite, not on crawling Jamendo:

- Catalog: ~362k tracks are indexed and queryable; any track ID returned by the API is in the catalog.
- Audio: a public MP3 is available for any track at a deterministic URL (see the repo README), so you can get audio without any API or extra file.
- Track display info: `track_id, name, artist, duration` for referenced tracks.
- User profiles: real users with their liked tracks (use as seeds for content-based
  taste profiles, not as co-listening signals). Each profile's likes span multiple artists,
  so they capture a genuine taste rather than a single album.

Good seeds for taste profiling and offline evaluation (e.g. hold out some of a user's likes
and try to recover them).

(If needed, the Jamendo public API is available for extra live data)

## Project ideas

Pick one, combine, or invent your own. Make Cyanite audio-based search central and keep
it explainable.

1. Search as a conversation (steerable discovery).
   Users describe a vibe in natural language and steer: "more energetic… now cinematic…
   add piano… less dark." An LLM translates the dialogue into Cyanite free-text queries +
   tag filters along tag axes (mood, energy, instruments, tempo). Surface the inferred
   prompt/filters each turn and justify each result from its tags.

2. Taste-driven personalized discovery ("Sounds Like You").
   Turn a user's liked tracks into a taste profile from the sound of what they like:
   aggregate their Cyanite tags and/or use their tracks as seeds for search,
   then recommend a personalized stream. Rank and explain each pick by which facet of the taste it
   matches, and let the user steer ("more like this", "less of that").

3. Personalized, steerable radio / continuation.
   From a user's likes (or a few seed tracks they pick), generate an ongoing recommendation
   queue via similar-by-ID re-ranked for tag coherence, with optional free-text nudges
   ("keep the mood but more orchestral"). Explain each next track via shared tags and
   let users accept/reject to refine the direction.

4. Explainable similarity.
   Seed track → similar-by-ID; for each neighbor, explain the match by comparing tag
   profiles (which moods/genres/instruments/tempo align). Use the representative segment
   for instant previews and the auto-description for narration. (Optional: use tag
   "distance" to re-rank away from an unwanted attribute.)

Stretch / bonus
- Cross-modal prompting: map an image, short video, or a written brief into a Cyanite
  free-text query; explain results via the resulting tags.
- Lightweight visualization of the result set (e.g. laid out by mood/energy).
- Real-time interactive UI, voice input.

## What to deliver

A working prototype + a short demo and a few sentences on your approach. Clarity of the
interaction concept and a convincing, explainable demo beat feature count.

## Judging criteria

- Interaction concept: a genuinely more intuitive / conversational / multimodal way to explore music.
- Use of Cyanite search + tagging: advanced, meaningful, audio-based use of the API.
- Recommendation quality: are the results actually good?
- Explainability: can the system justify its results convincingly?
- Execution & demo: does it work, and is it compelling?
